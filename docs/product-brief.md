# Product Brief

## Mission
Build a browser-based 3D Arduino robotics trainer that teaches STEM through guided assembly, wiring validation, and simulation feedback.

## Primary Users
- College beginners and makers learning electronics and robotics.
- Instructors running lab-style STEM sessions.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand power, ground, PWM, digital I/O, and signal wiring.
- Map control logic to actuator behavior (LED, servo, stepper).
- Improve debugging by iterating on failed wiring/simulation checks.

## MVP (Phase 1)
- Interactive 3D workspace.
- Core components: Arduino Uno R4, LED, servo, basic stepper module.
- Wiring console with pin-level validation.
- Real-time pass/fail simulation state and feedback messages.

## Out of Scope for MVP
- Full classroom analytics.
- In-browser STEP parsing.
- Large component marketplace.

## Value Proposition
Students learn faster by seeing direct cause-and-effect between wiring choices and simulated behavior.
