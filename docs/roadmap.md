# Roadmap

## Phase 1 (Current)
- Frontend scaffold and 3D scene baseline.
- Circuit graph model and validation rules.
- Uno R4 + LED + Servo starter simulation loop.

## Phase 2
- Guided lesson engine with milestones and hints.
- Scenario progression and scoring.
- Expanded simulator rules for stepper workflows.

## Phase 3
- Rich component library and challenge packs.
- Instructor tools and learner progress analytics.
- Optional real-board serial bridge hardening.

## Risks
- High-fidelity physics scope may increase complexity and timeline.
- STEP model quality variance can slow asset onboarding.

## Mitigations
- Keep logic-first correctness engine independent of rendering layer.
- Enforce strict STEP intake and conversion acceptance criteria.
